### This is Victor from September 2023 here... as for PWP project 9, I kinda just didn't feel like doing it... so I didn't lol
### Surprisingly enough my grade was still a B- so I ended up fine
### I hate using CV for boring things like finding some random curved line, I wanted to do something interesting which is why I didn't even touch project 9 and yet went all out in project 10
